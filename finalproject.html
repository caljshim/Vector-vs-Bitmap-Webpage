        </div>
        <div id="information" style="width: 925px">
            <p id="bmpInfo" class="infoText">A bitmap (or raster) graphic is created from rows of colored pixels that together form an image. Raster files support millions of different colors and shades for use in any kind of image. The three most common file formats for rasters are JPEG, GIF, and PNG. Some of the less common ones are TIFF, XBM, BMP, and PCX. Rasters represent the majority of images found online and are much more common than vectors. The image displayed on computer monitors is also a raster, as are the outputs of printers, scanners, and similar devices.</p>
            <p id="vectInfo" class="infoText">A vector (or an "object oriented") graphic is constructed using mathematical formulas describing shapes, color, and placement. Unlike a bitmap, a vector contains instructions about where to place each of the image's components. Some vector file formats include SVG, EPS, and PDF. Vectors are most often used for creating logos, line art, 3D-like renderings, and animations.</p>
            <p><div class="infoText" style="font-weight: bold;">Uses</div><div class="infoText">Both image types are useful in their own right, making neither one or the other superior to the other. For example, raster images are much better suited for photographs, brochures, or advertisements because rasters are more detailed at a fixed resolution. In the three examples named before, re-sizing or transforming the resolution isn't usually necessary. Vectors, however, are best suited for things like logos, text, or line-art because they can be scaled to any size without losing quality. Logos, for example, are very likely to be changed to fit multiple sizes by a company.</div></p>

            <p class="infoText">After playing around with the images for a little bit, you'll notice how the raster graphic begins to lose quality, while the vector doesn't. However, at the original resolution (although not a drastic difference), the raster graphic is more detailed than the vector.</p>
